# QLearnCatch

This is a demonstration of Reinforcement Learning using the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)
framework in combination with Theano / Lasagne.

We first create a [learning environment for the OpenAI Gym for the game Catch](OpenAI Gym Catch environment.ipynb).

Then we create an agent class, which implements a neural network to estimate
the Q-value function of actions.

## Requires

The following must be installed in order to run QLearnCatch:

 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - Theano
 - Lasagne
 - OpenAI Gym

## How to run

```
python qlearn_catch.py
```
